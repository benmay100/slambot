Keep Everything Running: Do not close your simulation or the slam_toolbox terminal. 
The map only exists in the node's memory, so it must be running to save it.

--------------

1. Open a New Terminal: Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 workspace

2. Now launch the custom map_saver.launch.py file using:
    ros2 launch slambot_slam map_saver.launch.py map_name:=my_maze_map  (or whatever you want to call it!)
--------------

After you run the command, you will see a confirmation in the terminal:
slambot_ws2/install/slambot_slam/share/slambot_slam/maps/my_maze_map.pgm
slambot_ws2/install/slambot_slam/share/slambot_slam/maps/my_maze_map.yaml


Note... if you then want the maps in the /src directory, you need to copy them from the /share directory into it! Note that both the slambot_slam package, and the slambot_nav2 package have /maps directories.
