Keep Everything Running: Do not close your simulation or the slam_toolbox terminal. 
The map only exists in the node's memory, so it must be running to save it.

--------------

1. Open a New Terminal: Open a new terminal and source your ROS 2 workspace

2. Now launch the custom map_saver.launch.py file using:

    * If not namespacing.... 'ros2 launch slambot_slam map_saver.launch.py map_name:=my_maze_map'  (or whatever you want to call it!)

    * If namespacing.... 'ros2 launch slambot_slam map_saver.launch.py using_namespace:=True map_name:=my_maze_map'  (or whatever you want to call it!)

--------------

After you run the command, you will see a confirmation in the terminal:

Saving map from '/map' topic to '/home/<your-username>/nav2_maps/my_maze_map' file



Note... if you then want the maps in the /src directory, you need to copy them from the /nav2_maps directory in your home folder into it!
